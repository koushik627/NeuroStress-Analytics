# NeuroStress-Analytics
NeuroStress Analytics is a project that explores EEG signals to gain insights into stress patterns. Leveraging Python and machine learning libraries, the project identifies key contributors to stress, 
assesses task-induced strain, and provides nuanced insights through advanced signal processing. This project has 3 objectives:
1. Classifying between stress and non-stress signals
2. Identifying the most contributing channels for stress
3. Identifying the most stressful task performed by the subjects in the dataset.

The dataset was taken from a research paper named SAM 40.
